## Current Status

Please note that my portfolio webpage is not yet fully updated and doesn't have all the amazing bells and whistles. To be honest, since I am still learning, I am having a hard time coding the responsive parts of the webpage. But I will try my best to improve and enhance it as I grow my skills!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
